Enables tolerant XML parsing, surrently for the suite's test results (JUnit, ..). 

Tolerated XML errors: 
    - Content is not allowed in trailing section
        This one is caused by ant/junit test results, ie a trailing character '>' in the end 
        of the test result XML file. Since the test itself is completed, we suppress a fatal error.
